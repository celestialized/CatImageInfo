For instance if you wish to rename a directory of 10000 images in a single directory to content appropriate meanings run this tool. For example ~/Pictures/IMG_XXXX.jpg -> ~/newpicutres/epcot.jpg\r\n>\r\n>`./rename_directory.sh <directory_of_destination_images> <directory_of_source_images> <echo_server_ip> <echo_server_port>`\r\n>\r\n>_note, cwd IS important, dont change_\r\n>\r\n>_note this tool also reports home to the echo_server tool_\r\n>\r\n### FREQUENCY ANALYSIS\r\n>This is just a small tool to group and sort the content provided in a different way, may or may not be useful .. we'll see later :)\r\n>\r\n>`./identify_popular_terms.sh <results.txt>`\r\n>\r\n>_note, cwd IS important, donâ€™t change_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A tool to gather information about images stored or gathered on a computer, and a reporting system for that","google":""}
